    </p>
    <p>
      We who are born into the world&rsquo;s artificial system can never adequately
      know how little in our present state and circumstances is natural, and how
      much is merely the interpolation of the perverted mind and heart of man.
      Art has become a second and stronger nature; she is a step-mother, whose
      crafty tenderness has taught us to despise the bountiful and wholesome
      ministrations of our true parent. It is only through the medium of the
      imagination that we can lessen those iron fetters, which we call truth and
      reality, and make ourselves even partially sensible what prisoners we are.
      For instance, let us conceive good Father Miller&rsquo;s interpretation of the
      prophecies to have proved true. The Day of Doom has burst upon the globe
      and swept away the whole race of men. From cities and fields, sea-shore
      and midland mountain region, vast continents, and even the remotest
      islands of the ocean, each living thing is gone. No breath of a created
      being disturbs this earthly atmosphere. But the abodes of man, and all
      that he has accomplished, the footprints of his wanderings and the results
      of his toil, the visible symbols of his intellectual cultivation and moral
      progress,&mdash;in short, everything physical that can give evidence of
      his present position,&mdash;shall remain untouched by the hand of destiny.
      Then, to inherit and repeople this waste and deserted earth, we will
      suppose a new Adam and a new Eve to have been created, in the full
      development of mind and heart, but with no knowledge of their predecessors
      nor of the diseased circumstances that had become incrusted around them.
      Such a pair would at once distinguish between art and nature. Their
      instincts and intuitions would immediately recognize the wisdom and
      simplicity of the latter; while the former, with its elaborate
      perversities, would offer them a continual succession of puzzles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us attempt, in a mood half sportive and half thoughtful, to track
      these imaginary heirs of our mortality, through their first day&rsquo;s
      experience. No longer ago than yesterday the flame of human life was
      extinguished; there has been a breathless night; and now another morn
      approaches, expecting to find the earth no less desolate than at eventide.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is dawn. The east puts on its immemorial blush, although no human eye
      is gazing at it; for all the phenomena of the natural world renew
      themselves, in spite of the solitude that now broods around the globe.
      There is still beauty of earth, sea, and sky, for beauty&rsquo;s sake. But soon
      there are to be spectators. Just when the earliest sunshine gilds earth&rsquo;s
      mountain-tops, two beings have come into life, not in such an Eden as
      bloomed to welcome our first parents, but in the heart of a modern city.
      They find themselves in existence, and gazing into one another&rsquo;s eyes.
      Their emotion is not astonishment; nor do they perplex themselves with
      efforts to discover what, and whence, and why they are. Each is satisfied
      to be, because the other exists likewise; and their first consciousness is
      of calm and mutual enjoyment, which seems not to have been the birth of
      that very moment, but prolonged from a past eternity. Thus content with an
      inner sphere which they inhabit together, it is not immediately that the
      outward world can obtrude itself upon their notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, however, they feel the invincible necessity of this earthly life,
      and begin to make acquaintance with the objects and circumstances that
      surround them. Perhaps no other stride so vast remains to be taken as when
      they first turn from the reality of their mutual glance to the dreams and
      shadows that perplex them everywhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetest Eve, where are we?&rdquo; exclaims the new Adam; for speech, or some
      equivalent mode of expression, is born with them, and comes just as
      natural as breath. &ldquo;Methinks I do not recognize this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, dear Man,&rdquo; replies the new Eve. &ldquo;And what a strange place, too!
      Let me come closer to thy side and behold thee only; for all other sights
      trouble and perplex my spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Eve,&rdquo; replies Adam, who appears to have the stronger tendency
      towards the material world; &ldquo;it were well that we gain some insight into
      these matters. We are in an odd situation here. Let us look about us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly there are sights enough to throw the new inheritors of earth
      into a state of hopeless perplexity. The long lines of edifices, their
      windows glittering in the yellow sunrise, and the narrow street between,
      with its barren pavement tracked and battered by wheels that have now
      rattled into an irrevocable past! The signs, with their unintelligible
      hieroglyphics! The squareness and ugliness, and regular or irregular
      deformity of everything that meets the eye! The marks of wear and tear,
      and unrenewed decay, which distinguish the works of man from the growth of
      nature! What is there in all this, capable of the slightest significance
      to minds that know nothing of the artificial system which is implied in
      every lamp-post and each brick of the houses? Moreover, the utter
      loneliness and silence, in a scene that originally grew out of noise and
      bustle, must needs impress a feeling of desolation even upon Adam and Eve,
      unsuspicious as they are of the recent extinction of human existence. In a
      forest, solitude would be life; in a city, it is death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new Eve looks round with a sensation of doubt and distrust, such as a
      city dame, the daughter of numberless generations of citizens, might
      experience if suddenly transported to the garden of Eden. At length her
      downcast eye discovers a small tuft of grass, just beginning to sprout
      among the stones of the pavement; she eagerly grasps it, and is sensible
      that this little herb awakens some response within her heart. Nature finds
      nothing else to offer her. Adam, after staring up and down the street
      without detecting a single object that his comprehension can lay hold of,
      finally turns his forehead to the sky. There, indeed, is something which
      the soul within him recognizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look up yonder, mine own Eve,&rdquo; he cries; &ldquo;surely we ought to dwell among
      those gold-tinged clouds or in the blue depths beyond them. I know not how
      nor when, but evidently we have strayed away from our home; for I see
      nothing hereabouts that seems to belong to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we not ascend thither?&rdquo; inquires Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; answers Adam, hopefully. &ldquo;But no; something drags us down in
      spite of our best efforts. Perchance we may find a path hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the energy of new life it appears no such impracticable feat to climb
      into the sky. But they have already received a woful lesson, which may
      finally go far towards reducing them to the level of the departed race,
      when they acknowledge the necessity of keeping the beaten track of earth.
      They now set forth on a ramble through the city, in the hope of making
      their escape from this uncongenial sphere. Already in the fresh elasticity
      of their spirits they have found the idea of weariness. We will watch them
      as they enter some of the shops and public or private edifices; for every
      door, whether of alderman or beggar, church or hall of state, has been
      flung wide open by the same agency that swept away the inmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happens,&mdash;and not unluckily for an Adam and Eve who are still
      in the costume that might better have befitted Eden,&mdash;it so happens
      that their first visit is to a fashionable dry-goods store. No courteous
      and importunate attendants hasten to receive their orders; no throng of
      ladies are tossing over the rich Parisian fabrics. All is deserted; trade
      is at a stand-still; and not even an echo of the national watchword, &ldquo;Go
      ahead!&rdquo; disturbs the quiet of the new customers. But specimens of the
      latest earthly fashions, silks of every shade, and whatever is most
      delicate or splendid for the decoration of the human form, he scattered
      around, profusely as bright autumnal leaves in a forest. Adam looks at a
      few of the articles, but throws them carelessly aside with whatever
      exclamation may correspond to &ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; in the new vocabulary of
      nature. Eve, however,&mdash;be it said without offence to her native
      modesty,&mdash;examines these treasures of her sex with somewhat livelier
      interest. A pair of corsets chance to be upon the counter; she inspects
      them curiously, but knows not what to make of them. Then she handles a
      fashionable silk with dim yearnings, thoughts that wander hither and
      thither, instincts groping in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole, I do not like it,&rdquo; she observes, laying the glossy fabric
      upon the counter. &ldquo;But, Adam, it is very strange. What can these things
      mean? Surely I ought to know; yet they put me in a perfect maze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poh! my dear Eve, why trouble thy little head about such nonsense?&rdquo; cries
      Adam, in a fit of impatience. &ldquo;Let us go somewhere else. But stay; how
      very beautiful! My loveliest Eve, what a charm you have imparted to that
      robe by merely throwing it over your shoulders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Eve, with the taste that nature moulded into her composition, has
      taken a remnant of exquisite silver gauze and drawn it around her forms,
      with an effect that gives Adam his first idea of the witchery of dress. He
      beholds his spouse in a new light and with renewed admiration; yet is
      hardly reconciled to any other attire than her own golden locks. However,
      emulating Eve&rsquo;s example, he makes free with a mantle of blue velvet, and
      puts it on so picturesquely that it might seem to have fallen from heaven
      upon his stately figure. Thus garbed they go in search of new discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      They next wander into a Church, not to make a display of their fine
      clothes, but attracted by its spire pointing upwards to the sky, whither
      they have already yearned to climb. As they enter the portal, a clock,
      which it was the last earthly act of the sexton to wind up, repeats the
      hour in deep reverberating tones; for Time has survived his former
      progeny, and, with the iron tongue that man gave him, is now speaking to
      his two grandchildren. They listen, but understand him not. Nature would
      measure time by the succession of thoughts and acts which constitute real
      life, and not by hours of emptiness. They pass up the church-aisle, and
      raise their eyes to the ceiling. Had our Adam and Eve become mortal in
      some European city, and strayed into the vastness and sublimity of an old
      cathedral, they might have recognized the purpose for which the
      deep-souled founders reared it. Like the dim awfulness of an ancient
      forest, its very atmosphere would have incited them to prayer. Within the
      snug walls of a metropolitan church there can be no such influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet some odor of religion is still lingering here, the bequest of pious
      souls, who had grace to enjoy a foretaste of immortal life. Perchance they
      breathe a prophecy of a better world to their successors, who have become
      obnoxious to all their own cares and calamities in the present one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve, something impels me to look upward,&rdquo; says Adam; &ldquo;but it troubles me
      to see this roof between us and the sky. Let us go forth, and perhaps we
      shall discern a Great Face looking down upon us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; a Great Face, with a beam of love brightening over it, like
      sunshine,&rdquo; responds Eve. &ldquo;Surely we have seen such a countenance
      somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They go out of the church, and kneeling at its threshold give way to the
      spirit&rsquo;s natural instinct of adoration towards a beneficent Father. But,
      in truth, their life thus far has been a continual prayer. Purity and
      simplicity hold converse at every moment with their Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now observe them entering a Court of Justice. But what remotest
      conception can they attain of the purposes of such an edifice? How should
      the idea occur to them that human brethren, of like nature with
      themselves, and originally included in the same law of love which is their
      only rule of life, should ever need an outward enforcement of the true
      voice within their souls? And what, save a woful experience, the dark
      result of many centuries, could teach them the sad mysteries of crime? O
      Judgment Seat, not by the pure in heart vast thou established, nor in the
      simplicity of nature; but by hard and wrinkled men, and upon the
      accumulated heap of earthly wrong. Thou art the very symbol of man&rsquo;s
      perverted state.
    </p>
    <p>
      On as fruitless an errand our wanderers next visit a Hall of Legislature,
      where Adam places Eve in the Speaker&rsquo;s chair, unconscious of the moral
      which he thus exemplifies. Man&rsquo;s intellect, moderated by Woman&rsquo;s
      tenderness and moral sense! Were such the legislation of the world there
      would be no need of State Houses, Capitols, Halls of Parliament, nor even
      of those little assemblages of patriarchs beneath the shadowy trees, by
      whom freedom was first interpreted to mankind on our native shores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whither go they next? A perverse destiny seems to perplex them with one
      after another of the riddles which mankind put forth to the wandering
      universe, and left unsolved in their own destruction. They enter an
      edifice of stern gray stone standing insulated in the midst of others, and
      gloomy even in the sunshine, which it barely suffers to penetrate through
      its iron grated windows. It is a prison. The jailer has left his post at
      the summons of a stronger authority than the sheriff&rsquo;s. But the prisoners?
      Did the messenger of fate, when he shook open all the doors, respect the
      magistrate&rsquo;s warrant and the judge&rsquo;s sentence, and leave the inmates of
      the dungeons to be delivered by due course of earthly law? No; a new trial
      has been granted in a higher court, which may set judge, jury, and
      prisoner at its bar all in a row, and perhaps find one no less guilty than
      another. The jail, like the whole earth, is now a solitude, and has
      thereby lost something of its dismal gloom. But here are the narrow cells,
      like tombs, only drearier and deadlier, because in these the immortal
      spirit was buried with the body. Inscriptions appear on the walls,
      scribbled with a pencil or scratched with a rusty nail; brief words of
      agony, perhaps, or guilt&rsquo;s desperate defiance to the world, or merely a
      record of a date by which the writer strove to keep up with the march of
      life. There is not a living eye that could now decipher these memorials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is it while so fresh from their Creator&rsquo;s hand that the new denizens
      of earth&mdash;no, nor their descendants for a thousand years&mdash;could
      discover that this edifice was a hospital for the direst disease which
      could afflict their predecessors. Its patients bore the outward marks of
      that leprosy with which all were more or less infected. They were sick-and
      so were the purest of their brethren&mdash;with the plague of sin. A
      deadly sickness, indeed! Feeling its symptoms within the breast, men
      concealed it with fear and shame, and were only the more cruel to those
      unfortunates whose pestiferous sores were flagrant to the common eye.
      Nothing save a rich garment could ever hide the plague-spot. In the course
      of the world&rsquo;s lifetime, every remedy was tried for its cure and
      extirpation, except the single one, the flower that grew in Heaven and was
      sovereign for all the miseries of earth. Man never had attempted to cure
      sin by LOVE! Had he but once made the effort, it might well have happened
      that there would have been no more need of the dark lazar-house into which
      Adam and Eve have wandered. Hasten forth with your native innocence, lest
      the damps of these still conscious walls infect you likewise, and thus
      another fallen race be propagated!
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing from the interior of the prison into the space within its outward
      wall, Adam pauses beneath a structure of the simplest contrivance, yet
      altogether unaccountable to him. It consists merely of two upright posts,
      supporting a transverse beam, from which dangles a cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve, Eve!&rdquo; cries Adam, shuddering with a nameless horror. &ldquo;What can this
      thing be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; answers Eve; &ldquo;but, Adam, my heart is sick! There seems to be
      no more sky,&mdash;no more sunshine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well might Adam shudder and poor Eve be sick at heart; for this mysterious
      object was the type of mankind&rsquo;s whole system in regard to the great
      difficulties which God had given to be solved,&mdash;a system of fear and
      vengeance, never successful, yet followed to the last. Here, on the
      morning when the final summons came, a criminal&mdash;one criminal, where
      none were guiltless&mdash;had died upon the gallows. Had the world heard
      the footfall of its own approaching doom, it would have been no
      inappropriate act thus to close the record of its deeds by one so
      characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two pilgrims now hurry from the prison. Had they known how the former
      inhabitants of earth were shut up in artificial error and cramped and
      chained by their perversions, they might have compared the whole moral
      world to a prison-house, and have deemed the removal of the race a general
      jail-delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      They next enter, unannounced, but they might have rung at the door in
      vain, a private mansion, one of the stateliest in Beacon Street. A wild
      and plaintive strain of music is quivering through the house, now rising
      like a solemn organ-peal, and now dying into the faintest murmur, as if
      some spirit that had felt an interest in the departed family were
      bemoaning itself in the solitude of hall and chamber. Perhaps a virgin,
      the purest of mortal race, has been left behind to perform a requiem for
      the whole kindred of humanity. Not so. These are the tones of an Eolian
      harp, through which Nature pours the harmony that lies concealed in her
      every breath, whether of summer breeze or tempest. Adam and Eve are lost
      in rapture, unmingled with surprise. The passing wind, that stirred the
      harp-strings, has been hushed, before they can think of examining the
      splendid furniture, the gorgeous carpets, and the architecture of the
      rooms. These things amuse their unpractised eyes, but appeal to nothing
      within their hearts. Even the pictures upon the walls scarcely excite a
      deeper interest; for there is something radically artificial and deceptive
      in painting with which minds in the primal simplicity cannot sympathize.
      The unbidden guests examine a row of family portraits, but are too dull to
      recognize them as men and women, beneath the disguise of a preposterous
      garb, and with features and expression debased, because inherited through
      ages of moral and physical decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chance, however, presents them with pictures of human beauty, fresh from
      the hand of Nature. As they enter a magnificent apartment they are
      astonished, but not affrighted, to perceive two figures advancing to meet
      them. Is it not awful to imagine that any life, save their own, should
      remain in the wide world?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; exclaims Adam. &ldquo;My beautiful Eve, are you in two places at
      once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Adam!&rdquo; answers Eve, doubtful, yet delighted. &ldquo;Surely that noble
      and lovely form is yours. Yet here you are by my side. I am content with
      one,&mdash;methinks there should not be two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This miracle is wrought by a tall looking-glass, the mystery of which they
      soon fathom, because Nature creates a mirror for the human face in every
      pool of water, and for her own great features in waveless lakes. Pleased
      and satisfied with gazing at themselves, they now discover the marble
      statue of a child in a corner of the room so exquisitely idealized that it
      is almost worthy to be the prophetic likeness of their first-born.
      Sculpture, in its highest excellence, is more genuine than painting, and
      might seem to be evolved from a natural germ, by the same law as a leaf or
      flower. The statue of the child impresses the solitary pair as if it were
      a companion; it likewise hints at secrets both of the past and future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband!&rdquo; whispers Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you say, dearest Eve?&rdquo; inquires Adam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if we are alone in the world,&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;with a sense of
      something like fear at the thought of other inhabitants. This lovely
      little form! Did it ever breathe? Or is it only the shadow of something
      real, like our pictures in the mirror?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange!&rdquo; replies Adam, pressing his hand to his brow. &ldquo;There are
      mysteries all around us. An idea flits continually before me,&mdash;would
      that I could seize it! Eve, Eve, are we treading in the footsteps of
      beings that bore a likeness to ourselves? If so, whither are they gone?&mdash;and
      why is their world so unfit for our dwelling-place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our great Father only knows,&rdquo; answers Eve. &ldquo;But something tells me that
      we shall not always be alone. And how sweet if other beings were to visit
      us in the shape of this fair image!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they wander through the house, and everywhere find tokens of human
      life, which now, with the idea recently suggested, excite a deeper
      curiosity in their bosoms. Woman has here left traces of her delicacy and
      refinement, and of her gentle labors. Eve ransacks a work-basket and
      instinctively thrusts the rosy tip of her finger into a thimble. She takes
      up a piece of embroidery, glowing with mimic flowers, in one of which a
      fair damsel of the departed race has left her needle. Pity that the Day of
      Doom should have anticipated the completion of such a useful task! Eve
      feels almost conscious of the skill to finish it. A pianoforte has been
      left open. She flings her hand carelessly over the keys, and strikes out a
      sudden melody, no less natural than the strains of the AEolian harp, but
      joyous with the dance of her yet unburdened life. Passing through a dark
      entry they find a broom behind the door; and Eve, who comprises the whole
      nature of womanhood, has a dim idea that it is an instrument proper for
      her hand. In another apartment they behold a canopied bed, and all the
      appliances of luxurious repose. A heap of forest-leaves would be more to
      the purpose. They enter the nursery, and are perplexed with the sight of
      little gowns and caps, tiny slices, and a cradle, amid the drapery of
      which is still to be seen the impress of a baby&rsquo;s form. Adam slightly
      notices these trifles; but Eve becomes involved in a fit of mute
      reflection from which it is hardly possible to rouse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a most unlucky arrangement there was to have been a grand dinner-party
      in this mansion on the very day when the whole human family, including the
      invited guests, were summoned to the unknown regions of illimitable space.
      At the moment of fate, the table was actually spread, and the company on
      the point of sitting down. Adam and Eve come unbidden to the banquet; it
      has now been some time cold, but otherwise furnishes them with highly
      favorable specimens of the gastronomy of their predecessors. But it is
      difficult to imagine the perplexity of the unperverted couple, in
      endeavoring to find proper food for their first meal, at a table where the
      cultivated appetites of a fashionable party were to have been gratified.
      Will Nature teach them the mystery of a plate of turtle-soup? Will she
      embolden them to attack a haunch of venison? Will she initiate them into
      the merits of a Parisian pasty, imported by the last steamer that ever
      crossed the Atlantic? Will she not, rather, bid them turn with disgust
      from fish, fowl, and flesh, which, to their pure nostrils, steam with a
      loathsome odor of death and corruption?&mdash;Food? The bill of fare
      contains nothing which they recognize as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, however, the dessert is ready upon a neighboring table. Adam,
      whose appetite and animal instincts are quicker than those of Eve,
      discovers this fitting banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, dearest Eve,&rdquo; he exclaims,&mdash;&ldquo;here is food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered she, with the germ of a housewife stirring within her,
      &ldquo;we have been so busy to-day, that a picked-up dinner must serve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Eve comes to the table and receives a red-cheeked apple from her
      husband&rsquo;s hand in requital of her predecessor&rsquo;s fatal gift to our common
      grandfather. She eats it without sin, and, let us hope, with no disastrous
      consequences to her future progeny. They make a plentiful, yet temperate,
      meal of fruit, which, though not gathered in paradise, is legitimately
      derived from the seeds that were planted there. Their primal appetite is
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we drink, Eve?&rdquo; inquires Adam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eve peeps among some bottles and decanters, which, as they contain fluids,
      she naturally conceives must be proper to quench thirst. But never before
      did claret, hock, and madeira, of rich and rare perfume, excite such
      disgust as now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; she exclaims, after smelling at various wines. &ldquo;What stuff is here?
      The beings who have gone before us could not have possessed the same
      nature that we do; for neither their hunger nor thirst were like our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray hand me yonder bottle,&rdquo; says Adam. &ldquo;If it be drinkable by any manner
      of mortal, I must moisten my throat with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some remonstrances, she takes up a champagne bottle, but is
      frightened by the sudden explosion of the cork, and drops it upon the
      floor. There the untasted liquor effervesces. Had they quaffed it they
      would have experienced that brief delirium whereby, whether excited by
      moral or physical causes, man sought to recompense himself for the calm,
      life-long joys which he had lost by his revolt from nature. At length, in
      a refrigerator, Eve finds a glass pitcher of water, pure, cold, and bright
      as ever gushed from a fountain among the hills. Both drink; and such
      refreshment does it bestow, that they question one another if this
      precious liquid be not identical with the stream of life within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; observes Adam, &ldquo;we must again try to discover what sort of a
      world this is, and why we have been sent hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? to love one another,&rdquo; cries Eve. &ldquo;Is not that employment enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly is it,&rdquo; answers Adam, kissing her; &ldquo;but still&mdash;I know not&mdash;something
      tells us there is labor to be done. Perhaps our allotted task is no other
      than to climb into the sky, which is so much more beautiful than earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then would we were there now,&rdquo; murmurs Eve, &ldquo;that no task or duty might
      come between us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They leave the hospitable mansion, and we next see them passing down State
      Street. The clock on the old State House points to high noon, when the
      Exchange should be in its glory and present the liveliest emblem of what
      was the sole business of life, as regarded a multitude of the foregone
      worldlings. It is over now. The Sabbath of eternity has shed its stillness
      along the street. Not even a newsboy assails the two solitary passers-by
      with an extra penny-paper from the office of the Times or Mail, containing
      a full account of yesterday&rsquo;s terrible catastrophe. Of all the dull times
      that merchants and speculators have known, this is the very worst; for, so
      far as they were concerned, creation itself has taken the benefit of the
      Bankrupt Act. After all, it is a pity. Those mighty capitalists who had
      just attained the wished-for wealth! Those shrewd men of traffic who had
      devoted so many years to the most intricate and artificial of sciences,
      and had barely mastered it when the universal bankruptcy was announced by
      peal of trumpet! Can they have been so incautious as to provide no
      currency of the country whither they have gone, nor any bills of exchange,
      or letters of credit from the needy on earth to the cash-keepers of
      heaven?
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam and Eve enter a Bank. Start not, ye whose funds are treasured there!
      You will never need them now. Call not for the police. The stones of the
      street and the coin of the vaults are of equal value to this simple pair.
      Strange sight! They take up the bright gold in handfuls and throw it
      sportively into the air for the sake of seeing the glittering
      worthlessness descend again in a shower. They know not that each of those
      small yellow circles was once a magic spell, potent to sway men&rsquo;s hearts
      and mystify their moral sense. Here let them pause in the investigation of
      the past. They have discovered the mainspring, the life, the very essence
      of the system that had wrought itself into the vitals of mankind, and
      choked their original nature in its deadly gripe. Yet how powerless over
      these young inheritors of earth&rsquo;s hoarded wealth! And here, too, are huge,
      packages of back-notes, those talismanic slips of paper which once had the
      efficacy to build up enchanted palaces like exhalations, and work all
      kinds of perilous wonders, yet were themselves but the ghosts of money,
      the shadows of a shade. How like is this vault to a magician&rsquo;s cave when
      the all-powerful wand is broken, and the visionary splendor vanished, and
      the floor strewn with fragments of shattered spells, and lifeless shapes,
      once animated by demons!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everywhere, my dear Eve,&rdquo; observes Adam, &ldquo;we find heaps of rubbish of one
      kind or another. Somebody, I am convinced, has taken pains to collect
      them, but for what purpose? Perhaps, hereafter, we shall be moved to do
      the like. Can that be our business in the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, no, Adam!&rdquo; answers Eve. &ldquo;It would be better to sit down quietly and
      look upward to tine sky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They leave the Bank, and in good time; for had they tarried later they
      would probably have encountered some gouty old goblin of a capitalist,
      whose soul could not long be anywhere save in the vault with his treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next they drop into a jeweller&rsquo;s shop. They are pleased with the glow of
      gems; and Adam twines a string of beautiful pearls around the head of Eve,
      and fastens his own mantle with a magnificent diamond brooch. Eve thanks
      him, and views herself with delight, in the nearest looking-glass. Shortly
      afterward, observing a bouquet of roses and other brilliant flowers in a
      vase of water, she flings away the inestimable pearls, and adorns herself
      with these lovelier gems of nature. They charm her with sentiment as well
      as beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely they are living beings,&rdquo; she remarks to Adam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; replies Adam, &ldquo;and they seem to be as little at home in the
      world as ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We must not attempt to follow every footstep of these investigators whom
      their Creator has commissioned to pass unconscious judgment upon the works
      and ways of the vanished race. By this time, being endowed with quick and
      accurate perceptions, they begin to understand the purpose of the many
      things around them. They conjecture, for instance, that the edifices of
      the city were erected, not by the immediate hand that made the world, but
      by beings somewhat similar to themselves, for shelter and convenience. But
      how will they explain the magnificence of one habitation as compared with
      the squalid misery of another? Through what medium can the idea of
      servitude enter their minds? When will they comprehend the great and
      miserable fact&mdash;the evidences of which appeal to their senses
      everywhere&mdash;that one portion of earth&rsquo;s lost inhabitants was rolling
      in luxury while the multitude was toiling for scanty food? A wretched
      change, indeed, must be wrought in their own hearts ere they can conceive
      the primal decree of Love to have been so completely abrogated, that a
      brother should ever want what his brother had. When their intelligence
      shah have reached so far, Earth&rsquo;s new progeny will have little reason to
      exult over her old rejected one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their wanderings have now brought them into the suburbs of the city, They
      stand on a grassy brow of a hill at the foot of a granite obelisk which
      points its great finger upwards, as if the human family had agreed, by a
      visible symbol of age-long endurance, to offer some high sacrifice of
      thanksgiving or supplication. The solemn height of the monument, its deep
      simplicity, and the absence of any vulgar and practical use, all
      strengthen its effect upon Adam and Eve, and leave them to interpret it by
      a purer sentiment than the builders thought of expressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve, it is a visible prayer,&rdquo; observed Adam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we will pray too,&rdquo; she replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us pardon these poor children of neither father nor mother for so
      absurdly mistaking the purport of the memorial which man founded and woman
      finished on far-famed Bunker Hill. The idea of war is not native to their
      souls. Nor have they sympathies for the brave defenders of liberty, since
      oppression is one of their unconjectured mysteries. Could they guess that
      the green sward on which they stand so peacefully was once strewn with
      human corpses and purple with their blood, it would equally amaze them
      that one generation of men should perpetrate such carnage, and that a
      subsequent generation should triumphantly commemorate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sense of delight they now stroll across green fields and along the
      margin of a quiet river. Not to track them too closely, we next find the
      wanderers entering a Gothic edifice of gray stone, where the bygone world
      has left whatever it deemed worthy of record, in the rich library of
      Harvard University.
    </p>
    <p>
      No student ever yet enjoyed such solitude and silence as now broods within
      its deep alcoves. Little do the present visitors understand what
      opportunities are thrown away upon them. Yet Adam looks anxiously at the
      long rows of volumes, those storied heights of human lore, ascending one
      above another from floor to ceiling. He takes up a bulky folio. It opens
      in his hands as if spontaneously to impart the spirit of its author to the
      yet unworn and untainted intellect of the fresh-created mortal. He stands
      poring over the regular columns of mystic characters, seemingly in
      studious mood; for the unintelligible thought upon the page has a
      mysterious relation to his mind, and makes itself felt as if it were a
      burden flung upon him. He is even painfully perplexed, and grasps vainly
      at he knows not what. O Adam, it is too soon, too soon by at least five
      thousand years, to put on spectacles and bury yourself in the alcoves of a
      library!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can this be?&rdquo; he murmurs at last. &ldquo;Eve, methinks nothing is so
      desirable as to find out the mystery of this big and heavy object with its
      thousand thin divisions. See! it stares me in the face as if it were about
      to speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eve, by a feminine instinct, is dipping into a volume of fashionable
      poetry, the production certainly the most fortunate of earthly bards,
      since his lay continues in vogue when all the great masters of the lyre
      have passed into oblivion. But let not, his ghost be too exultant! The
      world&rsquo;s one lady tosses the book upon the floor and laughs merrily at her
      husband&rsquo;s abstracted mien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Adam,&rdquo; cries she, &ldquo;you look pensive and dismal. Do fling down
      that stupid thing; for even if it should speak it would not be worth
      attending to. Let us talk with one another, and with the sky, and the
      green earth, and its trees and flowers. They will teach us better
      knowledge than we can find here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Eve, perhaps you are right,&rdquo; replies Adam, with a sort of sigh.
      &ldquo;Still I cannot help thinking that the interpretation of the riddles amid
      which we have been wandering all day long might here be discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be better not to seek the interpretation,&rdquo; persists Eve. &ldquo;For my
      part, the air of this place does not suit me. If you love me, come away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She prevails, and rescues him from the mysterious perils of the library.
      Happy influence of woman! Had he lingered there long enough to obtain a
      clew to its treasures,&mdash;as was not impossible, his intellect being of
      human structure, indeed, but with an untransmitted vigor and acuteness,&mdash;had
      he then and there become a student, the annalist of our poor world would
      soon have recorded the downfall of a second Adam. The fatal apple of
      another Tree of knowledge would have been eaten. All the perversions, and
      sophistries, and false wisdom so aptly mimicking the true,&mdash;all the
      narrow truth, so partial that it becomes more deceptive than falsehood,&mdash;all
      the wrong principles and worse practice, the pernicious examples and
      mistaken rules of life,&mdash;all the specious theories which turn earth
      into cloudland and men into shadows,&mdash;all the sad experience which it
      took mankind so many ages to accumulate, and from which they never drew a
      moral for their future guidance, the whole heap of this disastrous lore
      would have tumbled at once upon Adam&rsquo;s head. There would have been nothing
      left for him but to take up the already abortive experiment of life where
      he had dropped it, and toil onward with it a little farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, blessed in his ignorance, he may still enjoy a new world in our
      worn-out one. Should he fall short of good, even as far as we did, he has
      at least the freedom&mdash;no worthless one&mdash;to make errors for
      himself. And his literature, when the progress of centuries shall create
      it, will be no interminably repeated echo of our own poetry and
      reproduction of the images that were moulded by our great fathers of song
      and fiction, but a melody never yet heard on earth, and intellectual forms
      unbreathed upon by our conceptions. Therefore let the dust of ages gather
      upon the volumes of the library, and in due season the roof of the edifice
      crumble down upon the whole. When the second Adam&rsquo;s descendants shall have
      collected as much rubbish of their own, it will be time enough to dig into
      our ruins and compare the literary advancement of two independent races.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are looking forward too far. It seems to be the vice of those who
      have a long past behind them. We will return to the new Adam and Eve, who,
      having no reminiscences save dim and fleeting visions of a pre-existence,
      are content to live and be happy in the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day is near its close when these pilgrims, who derive their being from
      no dead progenitors, reach the cemetery of Mount Auburn. With light hearts&mdash;for
      earth and sky now gladden each other with beauty&mdash;they tread along
      the winding paths, among marble pillars, mimic temples, urns, obelisks,
      and sarcophagi, sometimes pausing to contemplate these fantasies of human
      growth, and sometimes to admire the flowers wherewith nature converts
      decay to loveliness. Can Death, in the midst of his old triumphs, make
      them sensible that they have taken up the heavy burden of mortality which
      a whole species had thrown down? Dust kindred to their own has never lain
      in the grave. Will they then recognize, and so soon, that Time and the
      elements have an indefeasible claim upon their bodies? Not improbably they
      may. There must have been shadows enough, even amid the primal sunshine of
      their existence, to suggest the thought of the soul&rsquo;s incongruity with its
      circumstances. They have already learned that something is to be thrown
      aside. The idea of Death is in them, or not far off. But, were they to
      choose a symbol for him, it would be the butterfly soaring upward, or the
      bright angel beckoning them aloft, or the child asleep, with soft dreams
      visible through her transparent purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a Child, in whitest marble, they have found among the monuments of
      Mount Auburn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetest Eve,&rdquo; observes Adam, while hand in hand they contemplate this
      beautiful object, &ldquo;yonder sun has left us, and the whole world is fading
      from our sight. Let us sleep as this lovely little figure is sleeping. Our
      Father only knows whether what outward things we have possessed to-day are
      to be snatched from us forever. But should our earthly life be leaving us
      with the departing light, we need not doubt that another morn will find us
      somewhere beneath the smile of God. I feel that he has imparted the boon
      of existence never to be resumed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no matter where we exist,&rdquo; replies Eve, &ldquo;for we shall always be
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
